  - Significantly reduced package size by consolidating files and improving tree-shaking.
  - Added native ESM support via modern Rollup outputs for better compatibility with modern bundlers.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.14.0

## 4.13.0 (2025-07-23)

### Features

- Added the [`evaluateAudiences`][evaluateAudiences] method. This method iterates over all Audiences Explorer segments, evaluates each one, and tracks the segments for which the visitor is targeted using the [`TARGETINGSEGMENT`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/apis/data-api-rest/all-endpoints/post-visit-events/) event.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue where `defaultDataFile` loaded configuration incorrectly when using the new [v3 data file format](sdk-config.kameleoon.eu/v3/<sitecode>).
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.13.0

[evaluateAudiences]: https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/js-sdk#evaluateaudiences

## 4.12.1 (2025-07-11)

### Patch Changes

- Stability and performance improvements
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.12.1

## 4.12.0 (2025-07-10)

### Features

- Introducing a fallback configuration mechanism via the [`defaultDataFile`](https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/js-sdk/#configuration-parameters) parameter. If no cached configuration is available, the SDK immediately uses the provided default. For version control, the SDK prioritizes the default configuration if its `dateModified` timestamp is more recent than the cached version.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.12.0

## 4.11.0 (2025-06-27)

### Features

- Added support for using a Custom Data value for traffic bucketing instead of the default visitor code. [Learn More](https://help.kameleoon.com/create-feature-flag/#Advanced_Flag_Settings).
- Added support for **304 (Not Modified)** responses from the SDK config service to avoid redundant updates and reduce traffic when the configuration hasn't changed.
- Added new optional parameter `instant` to the [`flush`][flush] method, allowing data to be sent to the server immediately without waiting for the next scheduled flush cycle.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.11.0

## 4.10.1 (2025-06-26)

### Patch Changes

- Fixed synchronization of the **visitor's legal consent** with the Kameleoon Engine (`engine.js`) when the SDK was initialized before the consent value was set.
- Fixed a potential error: `Cannot read property 'createCondition' of undefined`, which could occur due to differences in how various JavaScript bundlers or module loaders handle dependency initialization timing.
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.10.1

## 4.10.0 (2025-05-26)

### Features

- Added automatic detection of the [`PageView`](pageView), [`Browser`](browser), [`Device`](device) and [`OperatingSystem`](operatingSystem) types for targeting and reporting purposes. However, it can still be manually overridden using the [`addData`](addData) method.
- Added support for a **New**/**Returning** visitor breakdown filter in reports.
- Refactored targeting condition logic (remote data requests are now optional) for:
  - Time elapsed since first/last visit
  - New or returning visitors
  - Total number of visits
  - Number of visits today

### Patch Changes

  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.6.1

## 4.6.0 (2025-02-26)

### Features

- Added new parameter `stubMode` to `SDKParameters` for create `KameleoonClient`. This parameter enables a no-operation mode for the client, which is particularly useful for disabling external interactions in controlled environments.
- Added SDK support for **Mutually Exclusive Groups**. When feature flags are grouped into a **Mutually Exclusive Group**, only one flag in the group will be evaluated at a time. All other flags in the group will automatically return their default variation.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed validation for the [`networkDomain`][configurationParameters] parameter.
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.6.0

## 4.5.0 (2025-02-10)

### Features

- Added SDK support for **holdout experiments**. Visitors assigned to a holdout experiment are excluded from all other rollouts and experiments, and consistently receive the default variation. For visitors not in a holdout experiment, the standard evaluation process applies, allowing them to be evaluated for all feature flags as usual. Platform-wide release expected in February 2025.
- Introduced a new `personalization` parameter to [`RemoteVisitorDataFilter`][getRemoteVisitorData]. Default value of the parameter is `false`.
- The following targeting conditions are now supported:
  - Exclusive Campaign
  - Experiment
  - Personalization

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.5.0

## 4.4.0 (2025-01-20)

### Features

[configurationParameters]: https://developers.kameleoon.com/feature-management-and-experimentation/web-sdks/js-sdk/#configuration-parameters

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.4.0

## 4.3.0 (2025-01-17)

### Features

- Introduced a new `visitorCode` parameter to [`RemoteVisitorDataFilter`][getRemoteVisitorData]. This parameter determines whether to use the `visitorCode` from the most recent previous visit instead of the current `visitorCode`. When enabled, this feature allows visitor exposure to be based on the retrieved `visitorCode`, facilitating [cross-device reconciliation][CrossDevice]. Default value of the parameter is `true`.
- Mapping identifier is now persistent, enabling the assigned variation for a visitor to be retained when [merging sessions][mergingSessions] between anonymous and registered users.
- Added support for additional Data API servers worldwide, enabling faster network requests when the [`networkDomain`][configurationParameters] is manually configured.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.3.0

- Addressed a browser-related issue where, if consent was required or no consent was provided (no targeting delivery rules), newly generated visitor codes were stored in cookies after page reloads.
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.2.2

## 4.2.1 (2024-12-10)

### Patch Changes

- Replaced the nullish coalescing assignment operator (??=) with a more widely supported approach to ensure compatibility with older ES versions.

## 4.2.0 (2024-12-09)

### Features

- Added support for **simulated** variations.

- Added an optional `onError` handler for [`IExternalEventSource`][iextrnaleventsource] interface. If the `onError` handler is not provided the SDK would not be able to handle Real-Time Update server failures. Note: no action is required when using default Kameleoon event source solutions.
- Updated dependencies
  - @kameleoon/javascript-sdk-core@5.1.1

## 4.0.0 (2024-10-03)

### Breaking Changes

- `isUniqueIdentifier` parameter has been removed from methods [`flush`][flush], [`getRemoteVisitorData`][getremotevisitordata] and [`trackConversion`][trackconversion]
- Previously deprecated method [`onConfigurationUpdate`][onconfigurationupdate] has been removed from SDKs. Use [`onEvent`][onevent] method with `EventType.ConfigurationUpdate` to achieve the same effect.
- Previously deprecated field [`domain`][domain] of `SDKConfiguration` has been removed from SDKs. Use [`cookieDomain`][domain] field of `SDKConfiguration` instead.
- Parameter `text` of `KameleoonResponseType` used in custom [`requester`][requester] implementation is now mandatory, for the vast majority of implementations like `fetch`, `axios` or `node-fetch` it won't require any changes.
- Method [`initialize`][initialize] no more accepts `useCache` boolean parameter. Using storage cached client configuration on failed configuration request is now default behavior.

### Features

- Added new [`UniqueIdentifier`][uniqueidentifier] data to be used instead of removed `isUniqueIdentifier` parameters in some methods
- Added new [`SDKConfiguration`][sdkconfiguration] parameter `trackingInterval` to set the interval between SDK tracking network requests in _milliseconds_, default value is 1000, which is also maximum interval, minimum value is 100
- `FeatureVariableType` returned from the methods obtaining feature flag variables can now have two new `VariableType`s - `VariableType.JS` containing a `string` of JavaScript code and `VariableType.CSS` containing a string with CSS code

### Patch Changes

- [`getEngineTrackingCode`][getenginetrackingcode] method now correctly sets `triggerExperiment` parameter based on variable types
